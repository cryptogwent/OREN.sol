##What is Gwent?
GWENT is a card game of choices and consequences, where skill, not luck, is your greatest weapon. Pick a faction, build an army, and wage war against other players across multiple game modes. With hundreds of cards to collect — charismatic heroes, mighty spells and special abilities — new strategies are always a thought away.
Play your favourite card game and earn! Each card from your deck is an NFT token (BEP-721) that can be bought or sold on our Marketplace or any other (Opensea, Rarible). Win rare cards, sell them for a higher price, or use them in the game to increase your chances of winning — it’s up to you.

The internal currency of the GWENT is $OREN. For Orens, you can buy new cards for your deck on the Marketplace. Also, you can always exchange Orens for ETH to get your profit.
